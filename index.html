<h2>About</h2>
<p>I study the intersection of AI and society. My research examines how intelligent systems shape human behavior, cognition, and social organization—often in ways that contradict conventional assumptions.</p>
<p>My work identifies paradoxes created by AI and digital platforms: how social media can cause the most engaged users to learn the least, how making AI more honest can reduce user trust, and how AI-driven homogenization of content may paradoxically increase collective innovation.</p>
<p>Methodologically, I combine survey experiments, digital trace data, LLMs, and agent-based modeling.</p>
<p>In my book project, I am developing a theory of Human-AI-AI-Human interaction, examining what happens when people increasingly act through AI agents that interact with each other on our behalf.</p>
<p>This book serves as an attempt to understand the social and behavioral implication of artificial general intelligence (AGI), and the mass delegation of AI agents in our society.</p>
