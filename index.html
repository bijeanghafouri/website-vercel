<h2>About</h2>

<p>I study the intersection of AI and society. My research examines how intelligent systems shape human behavior, cognition, and social organization—often in ways that contradict conventional assumptions.</p>

<p>My work identifies paradoxes created by AI and digital platforms: how social media can cause the most engaged users to learn the least, how making AI more honest can reduce user trust, and how AI-driven homogenization of content may paradoxically increase collective innovation. I am also developing a theory of Human-AI-AI-Human interaction, examining what happens when people increasingly act through AI agents that interact with each other on our behalf.</p>

<p>Methodologically, I combine digital trace data, survey panels, experiments, formal theory, and agent-based modeling.</p>
